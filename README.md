# benchmarking-creativity

The purpose of this project is to benchmark the creative abilities of LLMs. Most psychological studies evaluate creativity using the Alternative Uses Task or similar divergent thinking measures, but these methods tend to emphasize only the originality of ideas and not their quality. Furthermore, they focus on the products, but not the process of arriving at ideas. Here, we adapt the Creative Foraging game (Hart et al., 2017), in which participants are given a decomino and asked to rearrange it into "interesting and beautiful" shapes to save to a gallery. We adapt the task to LLMs, measuring the area of the search space they occupy, their transitions between shapes, and the kinds of shapes they create. By comparing LLMs' creative search strategies to humans, we can understand their patterns of exploration vs. exploitation and identify potential areas for human-AI collaboration.
