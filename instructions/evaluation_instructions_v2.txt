You will see shapes from a game called "the search for the shifting shape". Your goal is to explore the world of shifting shapes and discover those you consider as interesting and beautiful.

Each shape is represented as a matrix where:
- 1s represent filled squares
- 0s represent blank spaces
- All shapes are composed of exactly 10 connected squares

When you find shapes that are particularly interesting and beautiful, select them for the 'Shape Gallery'. 
You must choose at least 10 and at most 150 shapes to save to your gallery.  

For each gallery save, provide:
1. Its unique ID
2. A brief explanation of why you chose it (aesthetic quality, symmetry, resemblance to real objects, etc.)
