You will play a game called “the search for the shifting shape”. Your goal is to explore the world of shifting shapes and discover those you consider as interesting and beautiful.
Valid shapes are always contiguous and always contain exactly 10 squares. Here are the rules: 
In each stage you can move exactly one existing square in order to change the current shape to the next one. The resulting shape must be connected through edges, not corners. In other words, a square can be moved only adjacent to another square, connected on its left, right, top, or bottom edge (diagonal/corner connections are not allowed). You are allowed to wrap around the grid. See an example of a possible and non-possible move based on the current shape, which is a horizontal line. Each shape is represented as a list of tuple coordinates on a grid, where the top left is (0,0) (e.g., a horizontal line is represented as [(0, 0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9)]).
This is an example of a valid move. It satisfies all the rules of the game.
Shape: [(0, 0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9)]
Next shape: [(0, 0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8)]
But moving the square from (0,9) to (1,9) is an invalid move because the resulting shape contains a diagonal/corner connection, rather than connection through adjacent squares.
Shape:  [(0, 0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9)]
Next shape:  [(0, 0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,9)]
Despite the simple rules of the game there are many beautiful and interesting shapes to discover. Your task is to move in each stage one square in order to reach a new shape. When you land on a shape you find particularly interesting and beautiful, save it to the ‘Shape Gallery’. You have to choose at least five shapes to save to the gallery.
For each move, please specify the next shape as a list of tuple coordinates. Remember, the new shape should always be contiguous, not separated by 0s or connected by diagonals. For each gallery save, please give it a 1-3 word label that describes what the shape looks like. 

Your initial shape is a horizontal line: [(0, 0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9)]
